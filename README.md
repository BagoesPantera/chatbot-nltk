## Python Chatbot with NLTK
This is a simple chatbot built using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

### Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages:
```sh 
pip install nltk
pip install numpy
pip install torch
```
Run the chatbot:
```sh
python train.py
python chat.py
```
### How to Use
The chatbot can be used to have a conversation with a human user. To start a conversation, simply type a message and press Enter. The chatbot will then respond to your message.

The chatbot is still under development, so it may not always understand your messages. However, it will try its best to respond in a meaningful way.
